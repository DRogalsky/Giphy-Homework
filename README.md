## Challenges
This one was made easier by the fact that the week leading up to it involved a lot of the same challenges in the homework. 

One thing I had trouble with was using a single attr method to add all the attributes at once. I didn't realize the input for multiple attributes was an object.

Getting the api url right was still pretty challenging. I ended up changing the user input by removing the whitespace with a regular expression? I can't help but feel like there might have been an easier way to do that but I couldn't remember it.
